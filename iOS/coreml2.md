# CoreML 2

* Create ML, a new GPU-accelerated tool for native AI model training on Macs. The tool supports vision and natural language, as well as custom data.

* When we quantize a model, we are reducing the size of the weight! In iOS 11, Core ML models were stored in 32-bit models. With iOS 12, Apple has given us the ability to store the model in 16-bit and even 8-bit model.

* Install `coremltools`

  `pip install coremltools==2.0b1`

* `Linear Quantization` is when you map the weights evenly and reduce them. In a `Lookup Table Quantization`, the model constructs a table and groups the weights around based on similarity and reduces them.

* Quantization is an accuracy tradeoff. Quantized models are approximations of the size of the weight, so it is always important to run your quantized models and see how they perform.
