# App Life cycle

> In iOS 13 and later, use UISceneDelegate objects to respond to  life-cycle events in a scene-based app.

> In iOS 12 and earlier, use the UIApplicationDelegate object to respond to life-cycle events.

> Scene support is an opt-in feature. To enable basic support, add the `UIApplicationSceneManifest` key to your app’s `Info.plist` file as described in Specifying the Scenes Your App Supports.

> In iOS 13 and later, always provide a launch storyboard for your app. Don’t use static launch images.
