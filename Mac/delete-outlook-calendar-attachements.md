# Delete Mac outlook calendar attachments

I found that the outlook calendar attachments used about 27G disk space using DaisyDisk. I deleted all files under `
/Users/user/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile/Data/Calendar Attachments` and saved 27G disk space.
