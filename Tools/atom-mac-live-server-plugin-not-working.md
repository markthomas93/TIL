# atom mac live server plugin not working

1. Restart Atom
2. Bring up the command palette (cmd + shift + p) and type "incompatible packages: view"
3. That screen will list all the packages that need to be rebuilt, just click on the "Rebuild" button
4. Atom will ask you to restart it, do so, and that's it, Atom Live Server is now working
