# Activation function

> A neural network without an activation function is essentially just a linear regression model. The activation function does the non-linear transformation to the input making it capable to learn and perform more complex tasks. Linear transformations would never be able to perform such tasks.

> Activation functions make the back-propagation possible since the gradients are supplied along with the error to update the weights and biases. Without the differentiable non linear function, this would not be possible.
