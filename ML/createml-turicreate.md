# CreateML Vs TuriCreate

>The key differences between CreateML and TuriCreate are:

>CreateML only works on macOS 10.14+, where as TuriCreate is cross-platform and works on macOS 10.12+, Linux & Windows 10.

>CreateML requires you to write Swift code in Playground, where as TuriCreate works using Python and can be written in any environment/IDE.

>CreateML only allows you create custom models to solve a limited set of tasks (such as classification, text recognition and regression), where as TuriCreate allows you to create custom models to solve a variety of tasks not supported by CreateML, such as Style Transfer (similar to how Prisma works), Object Detection and Activity Recognition.

>CreateML does not allow you to choose the model used for transfer learning (it uses VisionFeaturePrint_Screen), where as TuriCreate allows you to switch between multiple models (VisionFeaturePrint_Screen, Resnet-50 & MobileNet). Unfortunately, both frameworks do not allow you to choose your own model for transfer learning.

>CreateML allows you to tune an extremely limited set of parameters for a particular ML task, where as TuriCreate gives you slightly more flexibility in terms of tuneable parameters.
