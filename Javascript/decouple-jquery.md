# Decouple Jquery

> All in all, decoupling from jQuery would mean that we could rely on web standards more, have MDN web docs be de-facto default documentation for our frontend developers, maintain more resilient code in the future, and eventually drop a 30 kB dependency from our packaged bundles, speeding up page load times and JavaScript execution times.
